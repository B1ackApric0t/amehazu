extra scene

#Senpai
"So you're the kind of person who reads manga in the literature club, huh?"
#Haruya
"Reading manga is still reading."
#
Senpai had a chair right next to me and was peering into the manga magazine I had opened.
I was troubled because she had a nice smell.
#Senpai
“I wonder why the main characters in manga often have scars on their bodies.”
#
She muttered, staring at the character in a panel.
#Haruya
"Isn't that a mark? It means you have a special power."
#Senpai
“Hmm...”
#
Senpai took her eyes off the manga, crossed her arms and legs, and began to think about something.
It’s probably not a good thing, so I poked her.
#Haruya
"What are you scheming now?"
#Senpai
"I want to mark you too."
#Haruya
“What are you saying? Marking?"
#Senpai
"I'm not a dog. But, I love dogs."
#Haruya
“Haah…"
#
After a conversation without context, senpai brought her head close to me again.
When she peered into the manga, her silky hair hung over my wrist.
#Senpai
“Aren’t you going to turn the page?”
#
She looked at me with a sideway glance.
#Haruya
"I was just thinking."
#Senpai
“Yes?　About me?"
#Haruya
"That too."
#
Her eyes widened in surprise. I guess my comment was unexpected.
#Senpai
"Can’t you tell me?"
#
After some hesitation, I decided to nod.
#Haruya
"My body, too. It has scars."
#Senpai
"Huh? "Oh, that’s… Can I ask why?"
#Haruya
“Sure. Otherwise, I wouldn't be telling you."
#
She nodded.
#Haruya
"I had a big surgery when I was a child. I have a scar on my back."
#Senpai
”On your back?”
#
“Yes. I can’t show it to you, though."
#Senpai
“True that. You can’t, because you’d look too sexy.”
#
Is that comment appropriate?　I continue talking while wondering.
#Haruya
"After the surgery, I was convalescent for a while. It was during that time that I picked up reading.　My love for books started there."
#Senpai
"So this means the scar is your reason for joining this club."
#Haruya
"You could say so."
#
“That's right”, senpai muttered deeply.
#Haruya
"It’s the first time I tell anyone about this."
#Senpai
"Huh?　I’m the first?"
#Haruya
“Yes. At least the first time since middle school."
#Senpai
"That's... Somehow, it makes me happy!　But why did you tell me?"
#Haruya
"Why…?"
#Senpai
“Yep. Because you’re the type to think before talking.”
#Haruya
"Maybe I wanted you to know. "
#
I tried my best to mumble as if it was someone else's problem.
If not, I'd be even more embarrassed than I already was.
#Senpai
“Fufu… Was that payback for the information about me liking dogs?”
#Haruya
“You think? I’d say the price and cost proportion isn’t evenly matched.”
#Senpai
"Proportion, huh. Fufu..."
"In that case! I’ll accept any question from you.　I will answer aaaanything openly."
#Haruya
"Then… What’s you type? O-of dog…”
#
"The kind of dog over there”, she said, narrowing her eyes.
#Senpai
"That's what I like. A book lover that’s surprisingly not obedient. And that likes lollypops. Dogs with surgical scars on their backs.”
#Haruya
"I'm not a dog."
#Senpai
“I know. You’re my kouhai.　And I didn’t mention names. I was talking about dogs.”
#Haruya
"Ah, right…"
#
I directed my eyes to the magazine again.
This story, which started with the scars of a fictional character, passed through the scars on my back and ended up with a story about dogs.
#
Senpai’s arms suddenly wrapped around my back. My heart tightened from being hugged from behind.
#Haruya
"W-what is it?"
#
#Senpai
"I'm thinking of the scar on your back."
#
I looked sideways at her, who had her eyes closed. So pretty, I thought.
This person is beautiful.
#Haruya
“My story...　Was it that interesting?”
#
#Senpai
"Yeah! “Oh, but that’s because it's about you."
#
She snuggled up to me.
#Senpai
“Your back brought you to this literature clubroom.”
#Haruya
"It’s almost poetic."
#Senpai
"That's how it feels."
#
She released me from her embrace.
She then put her hand between the back of the chair and my back, letting her fingertips slide down the back of my uniform.
Strangely enough, the trajectory of her finger accurately traced my surgical scar.
Then she hugged my back again. She hugged me tighter than before. An embrace filled with loving strength.
#Senpai
"Maybe I'll think about the scar on your back many times from now on."
#
My whole body was stiff, down to my fingertips, and my heart was beating loudly. We were close to each other like never before.
And the fact that she was thinking about the wound on my back, which is related to my foundation as a human being, made the deepest part of my core shake.
Letting go of me, she closed her eyes and muttered as if recalling a distant memory.
#Senpai
"If a person had wings, they would probably grow on their backs…"
#
Why did she suddenly say such a thing? I couldn't know.
I had never even thought of imagining the scar as a wing.
A scar was a scar.
Senpai was the first to liken it to a wing.
The magazine fell out of my hand. Both hands freed, I touched her arm.
End of May. Dull, cloudy sunlight was streaming into the room through the windows.
The rainy season is coming, I thought. The rainy season with senpai.
