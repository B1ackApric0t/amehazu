#Rain Ayakashi
"You’re on time."
#
Amidst the pattering rain, the solemn voice of the monstrous shark resounds. From under the umbrella, I watch the grotesque mouth move.
#Rain Ayakashi
"The answer you have reached,　will you please let me know?"
#
I nod and take a deep breath in the moist night air.
My heart is about to explode, a sickening chill runs down my spine, and I fear I could lose my mind at any moment.
Even though I wish I could put off answering forever, I make up my mind and speak out.
#Haruya
"I have no intention of cooperating with you.　Because there's no need to do that in the first place."
#Rain Ayakashi
"Oh…?　I cannot seem to figure out what you mean.　My apologies, but could you explain yourself in a manner that even a dullard such as myself can understand?"
#
He’s both polite and rude.
At a first glance, you would think he treats others like equals, but in reality, he is overbearing and provoking.
I had a faint impression of his condescending attitude when we first met, but now it reached its peak.
I'm sure the Rain Ayakashi sees me as a foolish human being.
My whole body feels so oppressed my skin tingles, but I try my best to speak calmly.
#Haruya
"It's simple. There's no need to lure senpai out and bring her back."
"She will probably come to you instead.”
"Today, I talked to her at school. Although she didn't directly tell me, she mentioned graduating from school and leaving this place."
"I believe she’s set the time limit for her return to tomorrow.”
"So, could you at least wait until then?"
"Senpai will surely come back to your world."
"You don't have to kill me because she wouldn’t obey the order to come back. She must have finally made up his mind."
“So, why don't you go back to where you came from and listen to her side of the story!”
#
The sound of rain replaces my voice.
Like a rock protruding from the surface of the water, the Rain Ayakashi stares at me without moving his eyeballs and sinks into the ground for a few seconds.
When he resurfaces, he begins to speak slowly, as if to comment on my opinion.
#Rain Ayakashi
"Well.　There are various things from your story that bother me, but I shall put them aside for now."
#
I really hate his way of talking…
#Rain Ayakashi
"However, there is a serious mistake in your statements that I cannot overlook."
#Haruya
"A mistake? Where?"
#Rain Ayakashi
"You seem to have misunderstood, but the reason I have come to this world is not to bring back Yukino Akabane."
"By order of my master, I have come to kill Yukino Akabane.　She continuously refused her orders to return, so I said I would kill her for that reason. However, that does not mean I won’t be killing her even if she does return.”
#Haruya
"Wha- Why?! Aren't you two from the same place?!"
#
#Rain Ayakashi
"Sure, she’s of my same kin!　But it’s precisely because she’s a disgrace to our entire species that she must be killed!
#
Revealing his true nature, the shark monster bares his teeth and becomes furious. I’m so overwhelmed that I can’t move.
#Rain Ayakashi
"How dare a mere child of man speak so insolently! Did you even think of trying to convince me for Yukino's sake?!
#
With a big splash of water, the figure of the Rain Ayakashi disappears before my eyes. That's when I come to my senses and look around, searching where he has gone.
Feeling an unbearable pressure overhead, I instinctively put down my umbrella and look up at the sky.
Darkness. A cozy darkness. An endlessly deep darkness spreads behind the pure white teeth.
#Rain Ayakashi
"I should have done this since the beginning..."
#
I hear the muffled sound of splashing water.
#
My consciousness returns from the darkness. I can hear the rain.
#Rain Ayakashi
"Haruya Shitaji is here."
#
The voice of the Rain Ayakashi shakes my whole body, and I hurriedly stand up with a jump.
I look around my surroundings even though I feel like collpasing due to my hazy consciousness.
Darkness all around. I can't see the shark.
#Rain Ayakashi
“It looks like you just woke up.”
#
His deep, echoing voice makes my body numb.
I can feel his voice enveloping my whole body, as well as the lukewarm feeling of a wobbly and swaying ground. I’m vaguely able to guess my situation.
I’m inside the Rain Ayakashi’s mouth. As my eyes adjust to the darkness, I notice a row of majestic teeth layering on the top and bottom of my vision.
And the shadow I can see from within the his mouth is…
#Rain Ayakashi
"This guy's life is precious to you, isn't it?　Then, I'll trade it for yours. Do you understand?　　Yukino Akabane... Or rather, Winged Ayakashi: Kabane Shirayukihime, the Deathly Red-Winged Deity”
#
#Haruya
"Senpai!!"
#Rain Ayakashi
"Don't be noisy."
#
When I involuntarily lean forward and shout, my feet begin to tilt. The Rain Ayakashi has lifted the tip of his tongue.
#Senpai
"Haruya-kun."
#Rain Ayakashi
"Don't you move, Shirayukihime!!"
#
For a moment, I feel the illusion of my body floating up at the Rain Ayakashi's angry voice.
I somehow manage to avoid falling into the back of its throat, and the tongue finally regains its original flatness.
#Senpai
"Hey, Fukae… Do you really think that will work against me?　Don’t you know who I am?"
#Rain Ayakashi
"Of course, I do. If I fight you head-on, my odds of winning are slim."
"That's why I decided on this approach.　Apparently, you seem to have a deep bond with this guy."
#Senpai
"Even if you take a hostage, it would be easy for me to overwhelm you and recapture him. Isn't that right?"
#Rain Ayakashi
"Surely, it’d be really easy.　But I can crush this guy in the instant it takes for you to do so."
"And even if I die, there are still plenty of others who will take over after me.　I'm nothing more than a vanguard."
#
My life is being exchanged now… It doesn't feel real.
A story about a world that I don't know about, and senpai’s stern voice that I hear for the first time all. They seem like lies.
#Senpai
"Are you willing to die?"
#Rain Ayakashi
"I am here to fulfill my master's mission.　To do so, my life and death are trivial matters."
"Rather, surviving despite failing my lord’s mission would be the real death.”
#Senpai
;
"Pfft. My father sure is loved by his pet fish."
#Rain Ayakashi
"One can’t fight against blood.　Isn't that the reason you, too, are quite admired by this guy here?"
#
The Rain Ayakashi opens its mouth. Thanks to that, I can see better the scenery outside.
In the middle of the rain and darkness, I see hints of the white light of the moon. The raindrops scattered on the trees and plants reflect the moonlight.

The sight of the moon and raindrops drawing the colors of the flowers in the darkness is a sight to behold.
It’s the hydrangea garden.
An open space surrounded by flowers and plants. In its center, a familiar figure stands.
#Haruya
"You are… My senpai, right?"
#
#Senpai
"Haruya-kun."
#
In a complete change from before, her voice is terribly feeble.
#Rain Ayakashi
“That’s just right.”
#
Seeing a weakness in senpai, the Rain Ayakashi decides to attack.
#Rain Ayakashi
“Haruya. Is there anything you would like to ask her?　I'm sure there’s a lot you want to know. For now, I'll allow you to say a few words."
#
Am I not allowed to speak without his permission? Or rather, until now, it seems I didn't even have that right.
I can vaguely read his mood. The arrogance of the rain shark is something to be admired.
And so is his shrewdness. What he probably wants is for me to denounce senpai. It must be the motive behind cornering her like that.
As long as I can see through his calculations, I can't let myself be caught up in the Rain Ayakashi’s plots. The pale moonlight shines on senpai, and I can see her biting her lip and casting her eyes down.
I can't hurt her. However, I don't really have a clue what to say...
#Senpai
"Sorry, Haruya-kun."
#
She speaks up first. I am taken aback. I thought she was waiting for me to say something.
#Senpai
"I know I should have told you first,　and I’m sure there are many things you want to ask me."
"First of all, what the Rain Ayakashi said is all true.　I'm not human, and it's true that I attacked people."
"I’ve been hiding my identity. That's how I deceived you.　I'm sorry… I don’t know how to face you."
#
She says bitterly. Confessing one’s guilt must be painful.
But honestly.
Yes, maybe she has strayed from the right path, but I don’t really care about that anymore.
I don’t want to play the role of the executioner, like the Rain Ayakashi hopes I will. The one who can decree a sin is a judge.
But I am just the kouhai of senpai.
And now, as her kouhai, what I should say is…
#Haruya
"No! I was the one who deceived you...!"
"I really don't want to be away from you!! I'm not a strong person...!"
"Senpai, even you aren’t that confident, right?　You actually don’t want to go home, right...?!"
#
She had made up her mind to return, so I intended to give her a little push.
But didn't these words of mine plunge senpai into the depths of darkness?
#Haruya
"Why did you come to this world, senpai...?　　Why did you enroll in our high school?"
#
Without waiting for her reply, I kept pressing for answers. With the momentary sound of rain in between, she starts talking.
#Senpai
"I was raised by my father, like some sort of pet. I was confined in a room that was spacious and empty, had no windows and was like a bug cage. I spent my time without meeting anyone."
"That's why I wanted to get involved with someone.　So I forced myself to come here."
"But it was difficult.　Just getting to meet people wasn’t my goal, I wanted real bonds.
"But I couldn't do it very well.　Maybe it's because I'm not human after all."
"The deadline was approaching, so I thought I'd just give up and just go home.　Meeting you just before the deadline made me want to stay here a little longer."
"I have harmed many people.　I lost count on how many people I have troubled and hurt.”
"My guilt is crushing me.　And in the end, even you are in danger of losing your life.　I… really... Am no good. It's only right that I should disappear."
#Haruya
"That's not true!!"
"I always thought you were a great person."
"It's fun to get involved with people when all goes well, but when things go south, or you make mistakes, it’s really painful, isn't it?"
"Even when faced with setbacks, you've been trying to get involved with people, and that's amazing."　"I always thought you were a great person."
"You kept trying again and again, you should be proud.”
"The strong person is you, not me."
#Rain Ayakashi
"Enough! Don't you hate her!?"
#
My eardrums are about to burst from the anger of the Rain Ayakashi. He must be frustrated that things aren’t going the way he wanted them to.
But thanks to him, I’ve been able to say what I wanted to say. That's all I can do.
She closes her eyes while listening to my words. And before long, after a pause as if she was trying to grasp the meaning of my words, senpai opens her mouth.
#Senpai
"Thank you…"
#
Her hand glows white. Her fingertips run along the nape of her neck.
#Haruya
Senpai..."
#Senpai
"All the things you just said, they are my salvation."
#
I can see it.
Shining white fingertips engrave streaks of light on senpai's body. White light overflows from the cracks as if a dam had been bust open.
That’s the future I can see with my own eyes.
The long-awaited moment has arrived. She shows resignation. It’s time to fulfill her wish.
I manage an unexpected escape from the shark’s mouth.
The Rain Ayakashi’s momentary lapse of concentration is probably the only reason a mere human like me can escape from him.
As I run through the wet grass, I shout senpai's name.
#Haruya
“I won’t let you do that!!”
#
But I'm only human, after all. Even if I can outsmart a monster for a moment, I can’t take victory home.
#Rain Ayakashi
"You bastard...!!"
#
The Rain Ayakashi immediately chases after me. Just before being eaten by the shark, I manage to say it.
#Haruya
"I want you to live..."
#
As a human, or rather, as her kouhai, I was able to at least say that much.
#
The shark’s body is filled with black water. I’m drifting inside the monster shark as if in a violently flowing night sea.
There isn’t enough oxygen. My consciousness becomes vague. It’s the sensation of drowning or suffocating.
My thoughts become faint.
What’s the meaning of my words?　What kind of meaning can it have for senpai to be told to live?"
I don't know. The water is violently swirling.
If the shark hasn’t crushed me, does he still want to use me as a hostage...?
I don't know. I don't understand anything. In the midst of suffocation, my consciousness begins to be dyed with a feeling of floating out of place.
I see something in the darkness. It’s a white light.
That must be…
It must be senpai’s hand. I feel it clearly in the dark.
I’s out of sight. She grabs my body and pulls me up.
My body floats in the air. We’re flying in the sky.
#Haruya
"You are… Senpai, right?"
#
I ask, gasping for breath. I can’t hide my surprise at the figure of the person who pulled me up.
Long hair, white like moonlight. A jet-black body with scarlet wings and an expressionless face.
A beautiful and extraordinary figure. An existence unknown to our world.
#Senpai
“Yeah. I'm your senpai, Haruya-kun."
#
The voice that answers me is definitely my senpai's.
#Rain Ayakashi
"Curse you, bastards!! "
#
He shouts angrily and chases after us. Black water is gushing out from one end of his back, and it looks like he has been pierced.
Senpai stops in the air while holding me and stretches out her hand towards the Rain Ayakashi.
#Senpai
“Rain Ayakashi!! You said you’re risking your life to fulfill my father's orders!!"
“Then, I will bet my life here as well—!”
#
Her fingertips glow white, drawing a wall between us and the Rain Ayakashi.
Seeing that the shark is effectively blocked by the wall and crashes to the ground, she slides her fingertips onto her chest in a relieved gesture.
#Haruya
Senpai..."
#Senpai
"I’m alright. Don't worry."
#
There is a thin incision in her chest.
Then, as if her interior was filled with light, a dazzling beam of light overflows from the cut in her torso.
The light bursts out as if to split the night sky, but its power gradually weakens, and eventually it disappears as if it were an eye closing its eyes.
#Rain Ayakashi
"Shirayukihime!!  What are you―"
#Senpai
"I’ve returned the lifespan I had stolen into the sky. Now I won't be able to stay in this world for long.　I will return to our original world."
#
Neither the Rain Ayakashi nor I seem to follow. However, she continues regardless.
#Senpai
"Rain Ayakashi!　Your job here is no more.　Can you go home first and prepare for when I come?"
#Rain Ayakashi
"Are you insane?! Even if you return now, you won’t be spared!”
#Senpai
"I was going to kill you from the beginning, so it's probably too late now.　Rest assured. I don't have the time or the strength left to attack people anymore."
#
Saying so, she descends to the ground. It is so silent that the fight from a moment ago seems like a lie.
The battle is over.
The Rain Ayakashi is stunned, but eventually grits his teeth and mutters something. It sounds like a throwaway line, but I couldn't catch it.
Before parting, he glares at me and says:
#Rain Ayakashi
"Haruya Shitaji.
#Haruya
“Yes...?”
#Rain Ayakashi
"I'm returning this.　I can't take this filthy thing home with me."
#
Saying that, he spits out the umbrella I was holding when we were at my home. It was thrown open and bounced to the ground.
Leaving the umbrella as a souvenir, he sinks into the ground.
Silence. I can hear the rain. Before I know it, senpai has returned to her human form.
For a while, we stand side by side. My mind isn’t working properly.
An empty hydrangea garden.
I look down, to the ground.
Senpai has her eyes raised at the distant night sky.
