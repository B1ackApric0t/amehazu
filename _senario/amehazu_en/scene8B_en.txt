Rain. Darkness. The time is 10 p.m. Exactly one hour before the time set by the Rain Ayakashi.
With my smartphone in my hand, I lean my elbows against the desk, and I fret over the situation.
I can’t think clearly. I’m very nervous, waiting for her call.
I can't do anything.
I’m worried about her, but I can’t go check because the Rain Ayakashi would surely notice something.
What are you planning, senpai?
An incoming call. My body jumps up.
#Haruya
H-hello?
#Senpai
Haruya-kun?　It’s me. How’re you holding up?
#Haruya
I mean, didn't we meet in the clubroom just a few hours ago?
#Senpai
Well, people change.
#Haruya
In such a short time?
#Senpai
That's right. People's hearts are freckle, right?
#
Not knowing how to start correcting her, I remain silent. Then she continues.
#Senpai
From now on, I'll show you the proof.　Haruya-kun, can you look at the sky?
#Haruya
The sky?
#Senpai
It'll be a once-in-a-lifetime sight. Don't miss it.
#
I turn off the lights in the room just in case, and open the curtains and the window. Pitch-black clouds merge with the darkness of the night, and only the sound of rain echoes in the midst of it.
#Senpai
Are you ready?
#Haruya
Yes, but what's going on?
#Senpai
It's the end of everything. I'm breaking all the taboos now.
#Haruya
Huh?
#
Despite my confusion, the call is cut off. As I’m staring blankly at the sky, the center of the sky begins to shine brightly.
what's going on?　Is she doing that?
;
The light expands, little by little.
Just when I think it’s about the size of the moon in the night sky, the light condenses at once and the light becomes a mere dot.
I’m still watching the movements of the sky. Then, the moment begins.
From a point in the sky, a dazzling light spreads like a ring and runs through the whole sky. It’s as if a star were exploding.
At that moment, the night sky stars to twinkle with glimmering stars, and a huge full moon illuminates the earth.
The sky clears. The rain clouds in the area are cleared.
#Haruya
… Senpai…?
#
An incoming call. I raised my voice as soon as I pick up.
#Haruya
Did you do that?!
#Senpai
Indeed! It was quite beautiful, wasn't it?
#
She replies carefreely, while I’m overwhelmed by surprise, almost stunned.
#Senpai
With this, even the Rain Ayakashi can't chase after you. We can relax for a while.
#Haruya
Is it okay for you to do this?
#Senpai
It's not. But I don't care.　I feel the same way as you do.
#
She feels the same…
However, she and I seem to have different kind of strengths.
#Senpai
Then! Shall we meet? I'm coming to pick you up. Let’s see...
Your room had a window, didn't it?
#
She keeps going, as if nothing happened.
I see. Is this the path that we have chosen?
I take a deep breath. I need a moment to calm myself down.
#Senpai
Ah, you’re taking deep breaths.
#Haruya
What, can’t I?
#Senpai
No, no, go ahead.
Oh, I know! Can I take a deep breath too?
#Haruya
Why are you asking me?
#Senpai
There are people who get angry when imitated, right?
#Haruya
I'm not like that. Please do as you wish.
#
I hear a deep breath through the speaker. Making small talk calmed my heart a little. Maybe, as my senpai, she was taking care of me.
#Senpai
So, do you have any windows at your house?
#Haruya
We do, like one would expect of an ordinary house.
#Senpai
Fufu... Is that so?
Windows are something to be found in ordinary rooms, after all!
#Haruya
...
#Senpai
Sorry, let's get back to the topic.
I’ll head to your house and knock on your room window.　Then, I will wait in front of the entrance, so please come see me when you’re ready.
#Haruya
Got it.
#Senpai
Please close the curtains. I need to mentally prepare.
#Haruya
I like it.　It’s like we’re coming closer one step at a time, giving each other time.
#Senpai
Isn't that a great idea?
#
I can hear her take a breath. Then, she says in a faintly trembling voice:
#Senpai
I'll come in my true form. Don't be surprised.
#
For some reason, those words make my heart beat fast. I also take a deep breath and reply.
#Haruya
Yes. I'll be waiting.
#Senpai
Then, I'll be here right away.
#
I hang up. I stand by the window and draw the curtains again.
Through the gap, I can peep the night spreading far beyond the window. It spreads far and wide.
#
Like we had agreed, I soon hear knocking on the window. I open the curtains, but there’s no one outside.
 Only the darkness of the evening.
I take a deep breath. Feelings of tension and exhilaration build up, and the area around the pit of my stomach seems close to bursting.
This is the same feeling as when I was heading to the meeting place on the day we went to the hydrangea garden.
I open the door of the room and stand in front of the mirror, wondering what to do with my belongings.
Do I need a wallet in this case? I’m rushing and end up leaving the room with nothing. I think it's the most appropriate.
I quietly pass through the dark corridor and carefully descend the stairs. Standing in front of the entrance door, I take a deep breath.
That wasn’t enough, so I squat down, holding my head in my hands, and I mutter.
Senpai, senpai…
I'm ready. I have made up my mind.
I open the front door with a trembling hand, to my surprise.
#Haruya
… Senpai…?
#
There’s something unhuman standing there. Yes, they could never be human, but they were too beautiful to be called monsters.
It was a one-of-a-kind existence that seemed to have nothing similar to the beings of this world.
#Haruya
Senpai... That’s you, right?
#Senpai
Yes, it's me. Nice to meet you.　Yukino Akabane has changed into the Winged Ayakashi: Kabane Shirayukihime, the Deathly Red-Winged Deity. These are my real appearance and name.
#
Her long white hair flutters in the night breeze, just like the flow of a silvery river. Red butterfly-like wings spread out behind her slender, jet-black body. And most of all, what catches my eye most is that she is a figure who doesn’t have a face.
When I stare at her for a while, she smiles as if embarrassed.
I realize that I have been watching too much, so I hurriedly averted my gaze. It’s a little awkward.
#Senpai
Surely, I shouldn't have come.
#
She says quietly.
#Haruya
Do you hate having met me?
#Senpai
That’s not it, but… It’s true that I shouldn't have met you, nor should I have shown you this form.
#Haruya
But now we have met and you’re showing it to me.
#Senpai
And that is a problem.
#
"Yeah…", she sighs. The atmosphere is like “what’s done is done”. Then she looks up at the sky and murmurs.
#Senpai
It's because the moon is so bright.
#
Her hand reaches out and wraps around my right cheek.
#Senpai
They say the moon drives people crazy.
#Haruya
Like lunacy?
#Senpai
Yeah. We’re probably a little crazy, both you and I.
#Haruya
Is it that surprising?　I was told something crazy, so now I’m crazy.
#Senpai
And even then, you still wanted to see me.
#Haruya
I wanted to see you even more.
#Senpai
What a weirdo.
#Haruya
I don't want weird people calling me that.
#Senpai
I'm not human.
#Haruya
I don't want weird creatures calling me that.
#
With a sigh, I put my hand on senpai’s hand.
#Haruya
You aren’t human...
#
Words that sound like soliloquy leak out of my mouth.
#Haruya
You aren’t human, senpai.
#Senpai
What did you think?
#Haruya
What’s with this question?　Nothing special...　I thought you were a normal human being, but I didn't think you were a normal person.
#Senpai
What's the opposite of normal? Abnormal?
#Haruya
Special.
#
I reply by reflex. Surprised at myself, I break into cold sweat.
Normally I would quickly take it back, that’s not the case now.
I gently take her hand that’s resting on my cheek to my chest, and I put my other hand on top of hers. I looked up at the senpai’s faceless face, and say again:
#Haruya
You’re special... For me, senpai is senpai.　Whether or not you're a human being, that changes nothing for me and I can’t help it.
#
There is no expression on her face. We stare at each other for a while, but eventually her hand slips out of mine and puts it around my back.
#Senpai
Aren’t you scared?
#Haruya
Scared of… You?
#Senpai
Yes.
#Haruya
Not at all... Well, not beyond you being an upperclassman.
#Senpai
Ah...
#
She takes a long breath and hugs me tightly.
#Senpai
I was scared…
#
A faint voice.
#Haruya
Eh?　You were?
#Senpai
That's right... Because, if I showed myself to you like this... What should I do if you reject me…
#Haruya
That's a baseless worry. I think you’re beautiful.
#Senpai
Beautiful?　Did you say beautiful?
#Haruya
Yes… I mean, no!　It’s not “beautiful” as in, for people, it’s like the beauty of flowers and butterflies…
#Senpai
I get it. But you don't have to be so embarrassed.　It's a moonlit night's rendezvous.
#Haruya
There's something about that too...
#Senpai
I know. Let's talk calmly later... But, I’m only me.　I came because I was happy to be called.
#Haruya
You were happy?
#
She lets out a sigh as if a weight has been lifted from her shoulders. Then she look up at the full moon in the sky again and say:
#Senpai
Night makes people bold.
#Haruya
No doubt about it.
#Senpai
When tomorrow comes, I might be too embarrassed to see you again.
#Haruya
But will there be a tomorrow?
#
She says nothing, and I don’t say anything either.
I love this silence.
#Senpai
Let’s go, Haruya-kun.
#Haruya
Where to?
#Senpai
The hydrangea garden! I couldn’t take it easy before. What do you say?
#Haruya
Okay, but how do we get there?
#Senpai
With my wings.
#
She picks me up and I leave myself to her. My body gently floats in the air, and soon my eyes go beyond the roof of the houses.
#Senpai
Don't look down. I'm sure you'll be scared.
#Haruya
Understood. Then... Can I look at you?
#
Wobble.
#Haruya
Hey- senpai?!
#
The ground and sky rotate. The lights of the houses trail in circles, I see the night sky in front of me.
Then senpai says after regaining her balance:
#Senpai
Talking is forbidden.
#Haruya
Is this a night bus or something?
#
After that, we continue the night flight while chatting. We weave through the clouds in the night sky while basking in the full moon.
Surely, if someone looked at us from a distance, we would have become a single dot running through the sky.
