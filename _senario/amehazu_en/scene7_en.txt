#
The following day after school, in the literature clubroom. I throw my bag on the desk and put my face down.
I attended school as usual, but I couldn’t focus. I managed to somehow make it through.
#Rain Ayakashi
"On the morrow at night, it will rain again. I shall listen to your reply at that time.　I would like you to fully consider it until then."
#
I keep thinking about it, but I can’t come up with an answer.
Since last night, the serial murder case has increased the number of victims by two. Maybe the Rain Ayakashi wasn’t just talking crap.
However, I can't betray senpai.
It seems she isn’t human and is attacking people at night. Even though the truth is unknown, it’s still a shock that I can hardly accept.
I want to talk to senpai, but I haven't met her since our visit to the hydrangea garden.
In the first place, the Rain Ayakashi is observing my movements from the rain.
Of course, it would be a lie if I said I’m not afraid of the Rain Ayakashi. Even now, his gigantic gums keep flashing through my mind. That sight frightened me and made me feel my powerlessness.
I’m frustrated. And scared.
I'm definitely not going to cooperate, but when I think about what may happen to me, I can't help but waver in my decision.
My mind is in chaos. I can’t think clearly.
What should I do?
#??
"Uh. Shitaji-kun is dead."
#
The sudden sound of the door, followed by a voice I hadn’t heard in a while, made me turn around.
#??
"Hi there."
#
#Haruya
“Hello, president… It’s been a while.”
#Club President
"Right. How have you been?"
#Haruya
"I have been... Okay."
#Club President
"Your complexion tells me you're lying."
#
The club president. She’s as detached as always.
#Haruya
"Do you have something to do here?"
#Club President
"Sure do. I want to borrow some books."
#
There’s a bookshelf in the corner of the literature club room.
The club magazine is there, and the books brought in by club members are lined up so that anyone can read them freely.
#Club President
“You came solo today?”
#Haruya
"Yes. Senpai isn't here yet."
#Club President
"How unusual. She’s always the first to arrive. Maybe she’s busy today."
#Haruya
"I wonder... It seems like she didn’t come to school yesterday."
#Club President
"Oh?　Earth-shattering. Even though she’s the very picture of good health.　A picture equipped with a perpetual motion engine.”
#Haruya
"Well, senpai is always fine, though."
#Club President
"She’s not fine. She’s beyond admirable, she’s like a monst…”
#
The president suddenly stops digging through the bookshelves. She tilts her head and looks up at the ceiling for a second, then she turns to face me and says:
#Club President
"80% of the time, mindless talk is what digs one’s grave.”
#Haruya
"You really dug itself into a hole.”
#Club President
“I shot myself in the bed I made, and now must lie on my foot."
#Haruya
"Wait, that’s not how those idioms go!”
#
The president nods. Then she starts rummaging through the bookshelves again.
I can't quite figure out what she’s nodding to, but something suddenly bothers me, so I ask her.
#Haruya
“Come to think of it, both you and Yukino-senpai have written for the club magazine before.”
#
#Club President
"That’s taboo."
#Haruya
“Eh?”
#Club President
"Reading the club magazine inside the club room is forbidden.　This is a pact among the members of the literature club to maintain our mutual mental well-being.　It can save lives.”
#Haruya
“Your life, for example?”
#Club President
“My life, for example.”
#
I see. So I better not touch it now…
#Club President
"Shitaji-kun, you should also be prepared. The fate of writing in the club magazine is equal for everyone.　Such a cruel thing."
#
I... See…
After stuffing several books into her bag, she stands up and stretches.
#Haruya
"Are you going home?"
#Club President
“Yes. I’m done with what I came here for. Good work today."
#
#Haruya
“Ah-” “Um…"
#
When I stop her, who was already heading toward the door, she turns around.
I wonder if it would be strange to ask such a question out of the blue, but since I have already called out to her, I can't withdraw now.
#Haruya
“President, do you know why Yukino-senpai joined the literature club?”
#Club President
"I was never made privy to such information."
#Haruya
“Ah-” "Oh, so you don't know..."
#
I’m surprised by her answer. In addition to the particular wording, I’m taken aback because she doesn’t seem to know a lot about senpai.
#Club President
"Did you think I knew?"
#
She asks as if she read through my mind. I’m unable to read the emotions of the eyes peeking behind the glasses.
#Haruya
“Weren’t you also in this club with Yukino-senpai last year?　That's why I thought you would know."
#
At my words, she brushes her bangs and sighs. She seems hesitant for a bit, but apparently decides to reply.
#Club President
"I'm not interested in knowing such a thing. Or I pretend I'm not."
#Haruya
"Huh?
#Club President
"If you're interested in someone, that means you want to get involved with said person, right?　I'm tired of doing that. So, I abandoned that fight.　There’s no profit, but also no losses. I don't want to bet on anything.
#
I had no idea she felt that way.
This girl…
She seems very similar to me.
#Club President
"Bane-chan is amazing. It’s like her chips flow out endlessly.　Even when she loses, the holes get filled again.　Maybe that’s how you eventually become rich.”
"That's what it means being worthy of respect."
#
I understand what the director is trying to say.
But is it really true?
#Senpai
"I'm sorry. Could it be that I've been saying weird things all this time?" 』
#
Is senpai really as invincible as the president says? Even if it's eventually filled, isn’t a hole still a hole?
Even if the pain disappears, isn't a wound still a wound?
#Club President
"Well, I'm going. See you."
#Haruya
“Yes. Good work today."
#
She puts her hand on the door handle, but she suddenly seems to remember something, and turns around.
#Club President
"The club magazine. Why don't you take a look?"
"I think Bane-chan wrote something."
#
The club magazine. I’m surprised by her unexpected suggestion.
#Haruya
“Isn’t reading the club magazine taboo?”
#Club President
"It's fine as long as it doesn't affect me."
#Haruya
"What a tyrant..."
#Club President
"I'm merely acknowledging my freedom and rights. And with this, I’m done here. Bye."
#
And with that, she leaves.
I’m left alone.
As soon as the president closes the door, I take out the club magazine from the bookshelf. Looking at the table of contents, I see senpai’s name several times.
As I approach the works one by one, I find a certain entry.

"Window" by Yukino Akabane – first year
I like books.
I especially like novels.
And I like looking out of the window.
No matter who you are, you only live once.
No one can ever escape their own lives and go into someone else’s.
Sometimes I wonder if life is like a bug cage.
Everybody is trapped in insect cages. Unable to go out and into the outside world,
I feel that I have no choice but to heap all parts of myself within the cage.
But there are books in this world.
A book is at least part of someone's life.
A book is a small outside world.
So to speak, it is like a window in a human room.
Through the window, you can see the scenery outside.
There is no exit from this insect cage, but there are many open windows.
And I like looking out of the window.
I'm still looking out the window from the literature club room.

I’m dazed for a while. When I regain my composure, I think of senpai.
What kind of life did she live in her original world? How did she come to this world?
I’m trying to imagine it.
A sound takes me by surprise and I turn around. It's the second time today that I turn toward the door after I hear someone's voice.
There she is.
#??
"Hello, Haruya-kun."
#
It’s senpai.
She comes in the room stumbling and sits down in her usual seat. Her complexion looks noticeably bad.
On my end, I hurriedly put the club magazine back on the shelf. Still, I don't think it's a bad thing to read the club magazine in the literature club.
#Senpai
“Ah!” Haruya-kun, that's taboo."
#
#Haruya
"The club president said so too."
#Senpai
"The president?　Did she come here today?"
#Haruya
“Yes. To borrow books."
#Senpai
"Aw, really? I’d have liked to see her."
#
Senpai says lazily, resting her hand on her chin. I wonder if her tiredness hasn't gone away.
#Senpai
"Feel free to read the club magazine."
#Haruya
“So it isn’t taboo for you?”
#Senpai
“Nope. “I don't really care."
#
I have already read what I wanted to read, though, so I don’t take it out again. Instead, I sit on my usual chair.
#Haruya
"Are you not feeling well?"
#Senpai
"Kinda... I've been tired lately."
#
For a second, she looks exhausted. However, she suddenly corrects her sitting posture.
#Senpai
"Hey, Haruya-kun."
#Haruya
"Y-Yes."
#
She calls out to me and speaks in a serious tone. Instinctively, I sit upright too.
#Senpai
"This is just hypothetical."
"If I had to leave here soon, would you be okay?"
#Haruya
"What's wrong, all of a sudden?"
#Senpai
"There’s nothing wrong, but yesterday while I was resting at home, I had this thought.”
"I was wondering what you were doing at school without me."
"I laughed by myself, because I couldn't imagine you being alone in this room."
"Am I being rude?"
#Haruya
“No. I can’t really imagine it either.”
#Senpai
"I see. If I’m getting your stamp of approval, then I guess it’s really fine."
#Haruya
"Is it even possible for you to leave?　You love our literature club."
#Senpai
"Is that how you see me?”
#Haruya
"That’s what my intuition tells me."
#Senpai
"Your intuition is spot on."
"But well… I think I could deal with it. I was well and alive before coming here, so I don’t think of it as some inseparable bond or anything.”
#Haruya
“But I think the way we live keeps changing, and so do our needs.”
"For example, cigarettes and alcohol for adults. They didn’t know the taste of it as children, yet many can’t let go of them when they grow up.”
"Isn't that the same with our club?"
#
Senpai sighs.
She gets up from her chair and leans against the window. With her back toward me, she continues talking.
#Senpai
"I have to graduate."
#Haruya
“Isn’t graduation still some time away?”
#Senpai
"That's right. Well..."
"I'm getting a little sentimental.　You see, yesterday I lost my perfect attendance at both club and school.　I’m a little down.”
#
She looks back at me with a troubled smile.
―She said my intuition is good.
If so, then surely this is a roundabout way of saying goodbye. It's just my guess but she must have realized the situation she’s in after being attacked by the Rain Ayakashi.
Then, after thinking it through for a day, she has shown up to club again after coming to a decision.
She also most likely believes I know nothing.
But she’s wrong about that, as I have somehow been involved in it.
I don't know everything, but at least I do know what the Rain Ayakashi told me.
#Haruya
"Senpai."
#Senpai
"Yes?"
#
I have to answer her question.
#Haruya
"If you were to leave soon, would I be okay? That’s what you asked.”
#Senpai
“Oh, yes. Can you... Give me a reply?"
#
I can tell. At first glance she looks like usual, but I can tell there’s a hint of anxiety on her face.
#Haruya
If you were gone, senpai, I…”

[Options]
A: "I will live on."
B: "I don’t want that, even if it were to kill me."


scene7A
#Haruya
"I'll somehow manage. I don't know if I’ll live a good life, but I'll at least survive."
“While occasionally remembering senpai."
#Senpai
"Remembering…?"
#Haruya
“Yes, not forgetting. Even if you were gone, I'm sure I'd be able to live on thanks to you."
"I will never forget you."
"So don't worry. I'll be fine."
#Senpai
"You won’t forget…"
#
She mutters quietly. Then she laughs, troubled.
#Senpai
"I see. Haruya-kun is strong."
#Haruya
"Strong?"
#Senpai
"Yes, strong. Ah..."
#
Senpai lowers her face slightly and seems to be thinking about something. Before long, she looks up again.
#Senpai
"Are you free tomorrow after school?"
#
I’m at a loss on how to answer.
I certainly don't have any plans, but it's doubtful whether I'll live to face tomorrow.
#Haruya
"I'm free, but...　I'm just hoping I can get through today."
#Senpai
"What’s up with that? Do you have accumulated schoolwork to do?"
#Haruya
"Well, something like that."
#
Senpai doesn't seem to notice that my responses are vague.
#Senpai
"Then, Haruya-kun, please finish your homework before tomorrow.　I've been feeling a little tired lately, so I want to go home now and rest."
“After we're both in perfect condition, why don't we head out to the station?"
#Haruya
"Do you want to make memories before graduating?　It feels a little hasty."
#Senpai
"It's important to seize the day!”
#Haruya
"But haste makes waste.”
#Senpai
"No, I want to hurry.　The time I can spend wearing a uniform is short compared to the rest of my life."
#
She picks up her bag and walks towards the exit.
#Senpai
"So I’ll be going home now. What about you?"
#
After a moment of hesitation, I answer.
#Haruya
"I’ll stay a little longer."
#Senpai
"Okay. See you tomorrow."
#Haruya
“Senpai, I hope you get some rest today.”
#Senpai
"Of course! Tomorrow is going to be a big day."
#
Saying that, she left. I take a deep breath and exhaled slowly.
If my breath had a color, it would be a horribly cloudy and dark one.
I feel like I just said things I didn't mean. But to begin with, I'm not a strong person…
In this school life I haven't fully adapted to yet, this clubroom is, without a doubt, the place I belong.
And senpai is my main conversation partner.
The reason why I go out of my way to visit this clubroom every day is the expectation that she will be there.
If I lose someone who means this much to me, will I really be able to bear it?
I’m not sure. But I believe I had no choice but to answer that I can do it.
Otherwise, she won’t be able to graduate. Senpai probably has no choice but to go back to where she came from.
And when the time comes, I must not be the reason she can’t take that step. That’s why, I must hide my feelings.
However, that wasn’t the only lie in our conversation.
Hearing the phrase “making memories before graduation,” we both undoubtedly thought of the hydrangea garden we visited the other day.
As if we had a pact, neither of us said anything about it.
It’s a memory that created a rift in our relationship, so we wanted to bury it in silence.
That way, from the time we first met until the time we parted, our time together would have no flaws. There would indeed be some shaky moments, but overall, it would take the shape of a neat, clean line.
I'm sure that senpai, who isn’t aware of the Rain Ayakashi approaching me, is thinking that.
For this reason, I went along with her script.
I have a bad habit of looking back on conversations. I pick up my bag.
This is just my guess, but after school tomorrow, senpai will go out with me for the last time, and then she will return to her original world.
Tonight, that’s what I will tell the Rain Ayakashi. He came to bring her back, and now he can save the trouble of setting traps. They can reconcile.
For the time being, this will settle the matter.
I think I've created a nice storyline where everything falls into place.
Nobody can complain about this.
Yes, nobody.
With the clubroom behind me, I remember.
"Is it even possible for you to leave?　You love our literature club." 』
"I have to graduate."
That’s not an answer. Wrong, she never answered in the first place.
No.
Not answering is an answer in itself.
My feet stop. I start walking again.
I said I could live on without her. Based on my reply, we both moved accordingly.
Even though I didn’t freely choose the answer, it will determine my future.
I want it to end well. To achieve that, tonight’s rain is the final hurdle I must overcome.


scene7B
#Haruya
"Just thinking about it is painful. I don’t like it.　I’m sorry for making things difficult, but if you’re going to disappear after graduating anyway, I may as well say it.”
#
It may be unsightly. It may be pathetic.
But that’s my honest answer.
At least in this situation, I won’t be able to say I couldn’t express my real feelings.
Even if I’m unskillful, I don’t care. I'll say it even if clumsily.
#Haruya
"That's why, I don’t want that.
“Even if it were to kill me."
#
If I don't speak up now, I know I’ll regret it for the rest of my life.
Senpai widens her eyes. Is my answer really that surprising?
There was a stunned silence for a while, whether it was due to a loss for words or confusion.
After a few moments of silence, as if time had stopped, my senior asked me back.
#Senpai
"... Even if you were to die?"
#Haruya
"... Even if I were to die."
#Senpai
"Do you know what you’re saying?　I think those words carry a lot of weight."
"To me, this isn't something you can say just because you got carried away by the moment.”
#Haruya
"But I do mean it."
"My life is centered around school.　My daily life and my relationships revolve around school."
"I think everyone is like that during high school."
"That's why club activities are the center of my school life.　I come to school every day for club activities and to skip class."
"And for me, the center of the club is senpai.　I come to the clubroom every day to see you!"
#
My heart shrinks. I feel like I just said something very important.
Now that I’ve put it into words, it is irreversible. It’s shaking the very foundation of who I’ve been until now.
This thought suddenly comes to my heart, and I can’t continue my words.
The sound of rain echoes in my ears. I have suddenly forgotten how to breathe. I can’t look at senpai’s face, and instead drop my eyes at her school shoes.
#Senpai
"Got it."
#
I look up at her voice. She’s looking straight at me. With dark, deep, unfathomable eyes.
#Senpai
“Thanks, Haruya-kun." I understand how you feel."
"It’s alright if you die, right?"
#
A note of caution. I nod.
I don't know what comes next. I hate the future. The amount of time spent in high school may seem small when compared to life as a whole.
However, I am living as a high school student right now.
For me, the present is everything. This clubroom with senpai is the center of my world.
I don't care if I’m called abnormal or immature. Will I ever be able to find something in my life that I feel I can give my all to?
Will I be able to do that as an adult? Do such things exist in everyone's life?
So I just nod. I look into her eyes and nod.
#Senpai
... Yes, yes, yes."
#
At first, she nods mysteriously, but her movements become gradually lighter, as if she had been possessed and the curse has finally been lifted.
Her mouth relaxes. After returning to normal, she asks:
#Senpai
“Say... “There's something that worries me a little."
#Haruya
“Eh?”
#Senpai
"Haruya-kun, you said you don’t want me to suddenly disappear.　But I never mentioned disappearing."
"I’m just saying that I have to graduate someday, too."
"Are you misunderstanding something?　Or did you think I was implying I’m transferring to another school?"
#
A smile appears on her lips.
I don't know what she’s thinking, but I can tell she’s trying to find out how much I know.
#Haruya
“I thought you would disappear because it’s raining.
#Senpai
"What’s up with that?　That makes no sense, are you malfunctioning or something?"
#Haruya
"Come on now, I’m just imitating your usual behavior."
#Senpai
"How rude!"
#
She must have already figured it out. In order not to be caught by the Rain Ayakashi, we must slip hidden meanings into our everyday conversation.
A code, or a metaphor. It very much feels like a literature club thing to do.
#Haruya
"It looks like it's going to rain tonight. What a problem..."
#Senpai
"You only say that because you know me well. "
#Haruya
"Well, a little. You can't imitate someone you don't know."
#
She nods and huffs.
#Senpai
"Can I call you tonight?"
#Haruya
"Sure."
#Senpai
"Let's talk about the future."
#
She looks at the rain through the window. I don't know what will happen from now on. But right now I’m happy.
#Senpai
"Haruya-kun."
#Haruya
“Yes.”
#Senpai
"Do you like the rain?"
#Haruya
"I hate this rain."
#Senpai
"I thought so."
#
Dark rain clouds fill the sky far into the distance.
Will I ever see a clear sky again?
