The following day after school, in the literature club room.
Senpai is lying face down on her desk and stares at the sky with languid eyes. Her silky hair hangs over her arm and flows down the desk, flooding the tabletop in black.
Seeing that listless appearance, I can't help but remember what happened yesterday.
#Haruya
"Are you not feeling well?"
#
#Senpai
"Nope. I'm just tired. It's not like I caught a cold, so don't worry."
#
Her words ease the lump in my chest.
#Haruya
"It's rare to see you tired."
#Senpai
“Hmm... Yeah, it’s weird."
#
She puts her chin up on her arm and faces my way.
#Senpai
“Even though I see Haruya-kun’s face every day.”
#Haruya
“What am I, an energy drink?
#Senpai
“Must be because we haven’t done any skinship lately.”
#Haruya
"I don't remember us ever doing that.”
#Senpai
"Then let's start now!”
#Haruya
"Let's not."
#
When I say that, she once again puts her left cheek down on the desk.
#Senpai
"I wanna go out..."
#
She mutters quietly.
#Haruya
"Where to?"
#Senpai
“Have you heard of the hydrangea garden?"
#
I do know a little about the hydrangea garden she has just mentioned.
It’s a rather far place, and from our neighborhood, you can’t get there without changing trains and buses.
#Haruya
"It's quite far."
#Senpai
"Yeah, but I want to go... I like hydrangeas."
#Haruya
"Is that so?　It’s the first time I hear of it.”
#Senpai
"What about you, Haruya-kun?　Do you like flowers?"
#Haruya
"It depends on what kind. I like flowers like cherry blossoms, plums, and wisterias.　I think hydrangeas are good too."
#Senpai
"Do you have a type?”
#
She laughs.
It doesn’t seem she’s looking for an answer so, after some hesitation, I end up not saying anything.
#Senpai
"Hey, Haruya-kun."
#
She slowly raises her body and says:
#Senpai
“Don’t you want to go?　To see the hydrangeas?"
#Haruya
“With you...?"
#Senpai
"On our next free day. Together."
#
Do I want to go out with senpai and visit the hydrangea garden?
#Haruya
“Eh, ah, well...?”
#
My voice comes out strange.
#Haruya
“Isn’t it supposed to rain on both Saturday and Sunday…?”
#
I blurt out something that doesn't really matter. The weather being good or bad isn’t important.
#Senpai
"Isn't it nice? Hydrangeas look good in the rain."
#
Luckily or unfortunately, she doesn’t seem to care about the weather forecast.
Does that mean I’ll be going out with senpai?
#Senpai
"But… Yeah, I guess. People don’t usually go out when it rains..."
#
Saying that, she rounds her back and buries her mouth in her arm.
It’s painful to see her so lonely, and I feel the need to say something.
#Haruya
"But I think it’s good..."
#Senpai
"You think it's… good?"
#Haruya
"Yes, that even if it's raining..."
#Senpai
"For real?!"
#
Her face suddenly brightens, and I sense something has gone wrong.
With my comment I just meant that I think there’s nothing wrong with going out in the rain, or something like that.
She, however, seems to have taken it in a different context.
#Senpai
"Ahh, I'm happy... I'm looking forward to it!"
#
Looking at her smiling face, I can’t bring myself to correct the misunderstanding.
#Haruya
"Senpai."
#Senpai
"Yes?"
#
It’s my fault for not making my reply clear, so I want to fix it.

#Haruya
"Let's go out together on the weekend. To see the hydrangeas."
#Senpai
"Yeah!　I know! why don’t we organize the trip?”
#
And so, we start talking about our sightseeing plans.
As we finalize the schedule, the trip is quickly becoming a reality, and I grow more and more psyched.
At some point I stopped thinking, and I probably talked a lot of nonsense.
#Senpai
“Can you believe it, Haruya-kun?　We have the whole thing planned now!”
#Haruya
“Well, we did make it with the idea of carrying it out.”
#
By the end of our planning, I have calmed down. We will meet in front of the station before noon, have lunch, and then get on the bus. We will spend the afternoon visiting the hydrangea garden and sightseeing.
Perfect.
This kind of date is perfect.
#Senpai
“I want you to come prepared, Haruya-kun, because you’re an accomplice now!”
#Haruya
“Actually...”
#
I want to bring up a certain topic, but it’s difficult to do in front of her smile.
#Haruya
"I just want to make sure of one thing."
#Senpai
“Yes?　What is it?"
#
She tilts her head, and I begin to talk as if pulling a string of memories out of my brain.
#Haruya
"It’s about the hot topic of the last days… The serial murder case..."
#
Her eyes widen at my words.
A murder case has recently taken the world by storm.
Incidents have occurred nationwide, and the corpses left behind have been horribly disfigured. It’s even said that parts of the bodies are often missing.
The culprit hasn’t been caught yet, and since the range of the crimes is all over the country, it’s not possible to trace the culprit's footsteps.
Yesterday, a corpse was discovered all the way north, and today a new one has appeared at the far end of the south on the main island. Those mysterious incidents raise the possibility of multiple perpetrators.
#Haruya
"I just want to make sure.　Right now, we can't say that it's absolutely safe, can we?　But, we’re going anyway."
#
At my words, a little groan comes out from the back of her throat. Then, she takes a long breath.
#Senpai
“If you want to say that we’re being conceited or careless you aren’t wrong, but…”
"I think it’s fine as long as we don't go out at night.　And in the first place, we’re still going to school like usual."
#Haruya
“Alright. I just wanted confirmation."
#Senpai
"If you're worried, do you want to cancel?"
#Haruya
"No…"
#
I shake my head.
#Haruya
“We have already planned everything…”
#
#Senpai
"Right. Yes, that’s right.”
#
She laughs. She laughs, and I smile.
Suddenly, my smartphone vibrates in my pocket.
When I take it out, I find that a classmate whom I talk to often has sent me a photo.
Drawn on a blackboard, there’s a doodle of a shared umbrella with a heart, and two names lined up under it.
Haruya Shitaji and Yukino Akabane.
I don’t even have the energy to reply, so I just sigh.
Where on earth should I start correcting the rumor?
But there are a few things about the image that strike me.
One is the speed in which rumors spread.
The second is that the symbol of a shared umbrella with the names of a man and a woman below is still deeply rooted in our modern society.
And, finally, it’s the star quality of my senpai, whose name is known even to my classmates who don’t know her personally.
She has a kind of genius.
#Senpai
"What's wrong, Haruya-kun? Why are you sighing?"
#
She had gotten up from her seat and was leaning against the window, and now is calling out to me with her usual faint smile.
I close my phone and answer.
#Haruya
"I was thinking that I’ll be hanging out with an amazing person."
#Senpai
"Amazing enough to make you sigh?　You’ll make me blush!”
#
She laughs.
June. Looking at the sky through the window of the cramped clubroom, it looks like it’ll rain again.
