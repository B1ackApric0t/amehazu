scene 3

#
"From now on, it’s time to go around and look into clubs. To all the new students...”
Along with the school broadcast, the students leave the classrooms and step into the hallway.
The school is filled with voices. The flow of people, the voices of those recruiting new members... It's lively.
For the time being, I follow the crowd and escape into the corridor.
"Would you like to try track and field?"
“Are you interested in the drama club?”
There’s no club activity in particular that I want to check out.
I like reading, so I might peek at the literature club, although I don't really like writing…
On the other hand, if I go straight home then I won’t be able to make a decision.
There’s a lot of enthusiasm swirling around to get freshmen, and that attention is on me at times too.
And each time I give a vague, indecisive answer.
I wish I could say “no” more casually. After all, to them I'm just one more potential candidate.
I wander around the school hoping to escape from the crowd.
In the end, I wander into an unused classroom in a separate building away from the main school building.
It’s a place strangely filled with tranquility, and neither the voices of invitations nor any footsteps can be heard.
Even though no one is here, I feel nervous about entering a classroom on my own. I cautiously step inside.
Chairs and desks are neatly arranged and quiet. When must this class be used?
I lean back on the window.
You can see the cityscape in the distance, and the horizon is visible.
#Haruya
"Ahh…"
#
I look at my reflection in the window and sigh.
I have a feeling that the person I see there is going to spend his high school life as if it were someone else's problem.
If you don’t like crowds, you should just go home.
So then, why have I come to an empty classroom like this and I’m staying inside the school brimming full of newcomers and club invitations?
#??
“The view is nice."
#
I turn my head around at the sudden voice. A girl is standing next to me. A beautiful person with white skin and long black hair.
When did it happen?　I’m sure the door was closed...
#??
“The view is nice."
#
She gives me a gentle smile, a smile that looks as though directed at someone who has been with her for many years.
#Haruya
"A-ah... Yes, that's right."
#
I have a hard time replying properly.
I wish I could talk more casually, but it's difficult for me. I think it through before speaking. I also think a lot about the words I choose.
#??
“Yes.”
#
However, the other person nods without caring about my stuttering.
#??
"Very much so."
#Haruya
"..."
#
Somehow, she seems like a unique person.
She has a peculiar timing. No, I guess she's a peculiar person in many ways, since she's purposefully away from the bustling school building that’s busy recruiting new students.
#??
"Spring is nice."
#Haruya
"Is that so…"
#??
"The sky is bright."
#Haruya
"I agree."
#??
"It's completely different from winter."
#Haruya
“Yes.”
#??
"It’s warm."
#Haruya
"It's warm indeed."
#??
"It's spring."
#Haruya
"..."
#
What’s with this person?　Is she equipped with an engine that keeps her talking endlessly?
#??
"The air smells good in spring."
#Haruya
"Now that you mention it…"
#??
"Is it the scent of flowers?"
#
For sure. The spring air smells sweet. Where does this scent come from?
I want to open the window and try touching the spring air, but I look sideways and hesitate.
I fear that, if I open the window now, the conversation will go on eternally. I feel like I will have to talk to this person forever.
I'm not good at being involved with others.
It’s more than I can handle.
#??
"Spring has come to this city. A new spring."
#
… It seems that she can keep going even if even if you leave her alone. Whether you want it or not.
#??
"Looking at the scenery of the city like this…."
#
While saying that, she leans her back against the window.
#??
"It makes me feel like everywhere is a city. Right?"
#Haruya
“Eh...?”
#
Wait. I suddenly no longer follow.
I don't understand, but that doesn't mean I don’t share the feeling. It just means that I can't quite grasp what she’s trying to say.
#??
"I'm sorry. Could it be that I've been saying weird things all this time?"
#
When I’m at a loss for an answer, the other person laughs embarrassedly.
#Haruya
"No!"
#
Her expression was so lonely that I unintentionally raise my voice.
#Haruya
"Umm... Well, I mean..."
#
I think hard and finally squeeze out an answer.
"Looking at the scenery of the city makes me feel like everywhere is a city."
I can easily find a reason to agree with her. If you look at the city, then everything is a city. But is that all? This seemingly meaningless conversation, maybe there’s something deeper in it?
#Haruya
"This city... Eh, no... There’s a city wherever you go.　Because a city... A city... Is where people live."
#
I don't know what to say so, even though I’m talking, I have no idea of what I'm saying. I let my mouth move while my brain tries to keep up. If I stop now, we’ll be in silence.
Why am I even doing this…
#Haruya
"No matter where you are, it’s filled with places where people live, and people's life activities continue... I guess it's this kind of feeling, isn't it?"
#
The girl looks surprised at the answer I managed to work out. Then she laughs, and the tension I could feel from her is lifted.
#??
“Yeah. You understand! That was the correct answer."
#
Was it a quiz?
Silence fills the classroom again. At least I managed to overcome the city situation, but what now?
I look out the window again. I can't exactly leave just like that…
Silence.
I wish I could say something witty. Unfortunately, I'm no good at that sort of thing.
In the silence, the other person also turns to face the window. She stretches out her arm in front of me and unlocks the window latch.
The window is now open.
The rushing wind ruffles the girl’s hair. With her long hair blowing in the wind, she calls out to me.
#??
"The wind is nice."
#Haruya
“Right...”
#??
“Here, the window."
#
The person smiles.
#??
"You looked like you wanted me to open it."
#
Why?
This moment stays burned in my mind.
Back then, did I really want senpai to open the window?
At that time, I was struck by something like an incomprehensible deep emotion, and I couldn't say anything.
Startled, I snapped out of my abstraction, and I turned to face the window again.
No. Rather than to the window, I turned to the blowing of a new wind.

#??
"My name is Yukino Akabane. I'm a second-year student. What about you?"
#Haruya
“I’m Haruya Shitaji… A freshman.”
#Yukino
"I see. Haruya-kun."
#Haruya
“Yes.”
#Yukino
"Come with me."
#
I follow behind the person whose name I didn't even know until a moment ago.
We leave the classroom, pass through the crowds of the main school building and arrive in front of a small classroom.
#Haruya
“Um…" Is this…?"
#
#Yukino
"All club activities are in full swing.　I also have to fulfill my duties as a literature club member."
#
She opens the door.
The literature clubroom is a small room that makes me think it’s a storeroom or something.
There’s a large table in the center, and a girl who seems to be a senpai is sitting in the back. She has brown hair tied in two braids and wears glasses.
#??
"Welcome back."
#
#Yukino
"I'm back, president."
#
#Club President
"It looks like you harvested. As expected of Bane-chan."
#Yukino
"I'm more than happy to have met your expectations."
#Club President
"Hmm, expectations… I didn't have any particular expectations of you, though."
#
"Fu…," the club president laughs. “Fufufu”, Akabane-senpai also laughs. The two girls seem to have a unique relationship.
#Club President
"Want to take a seat?"
#Haruya
"Ah… Alright."
#Yukino
"Your seat is across from mine."
#Haruya
"Ahh…"
#Yukino
"You can open the clubroom freely.　The club advisor and I have the key, so when you want to borrow it, it’ll be quicker if you speak to the teacher in the staff room."
#Haruya
“Why are you talking on the premise that I will join the club?”
#
"Won’t you?"
#
I sigh. From the seat directly across from Akabane-senpai, I say:
#Haruya
"I… I think I will join."
#Yukino
"That makes me happy!"
#
She laughs and I smile. Senpai smiles, and then she looks out the window.
#Yukino
"Spring really is nice, after all."
#
She seems to be having fun and looks like someone reliable.
This person will take me somewhere far away.
That’s what I felt.
The three of us looked at the clear sky and the scenery outside.
Ah, indeed.
And tomorrow, senpai and I will go someplace far.
Following in the footsteps of my senpai, even if we never touch each other directly, we’ll still go far.
In bed. The feelings that had been scattered and itched in my chest are gathering, solidifying.
With a sense of security that resembles determination, I fall asleep.
