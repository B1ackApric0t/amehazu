Since then, the damage caused by the murder case has come to a sudden stop.
According to police investigations, the victims all had criminal records, had bad behavior, or were in trouble with someone on the day they were killed.
For the time being, the police are investigating the murders under the assumption they were work of someone acting like a vigilante.
I'm not going to say anything about this. It’s a fair assessment of the perpetrator.
Everything that left a trace of the senior has disappeared. It disappeared as if she had never existed.
I go to the club room, senpai is not there. Her seat is empty.
Even the assumptions and perceptions about senpai have been rewritten, and nobody remembers her.
The photo of her I took at the hydrangea garden that day has disappeared from my smartphone.
Memories are the only thing that retains any vestiges of my senpai.
Everything and anything that left her traces has been lost.
And even my memories were gradually washed away by the rain, becoming faint, thin, and vague.
Even if I write down her name on a piece of paper so that I won't forget it, the next day it will be blank. Even written memories are lost.
I’m the one who spent most of my time with senpai. There’s no way I wouldn't be affected by the law of coherence.
However, I was still trying to resist.
But then I lost track of what I was fighting against. I forgot that I was even fighting.
And the world went back to normal.
With one exception.
At some point, I had photos on my smartphone that I didn't remember taking.
At first glance, it looks like a cheap prank, but I don't know why I would be saving such an image. I don't even remember the other person's name.
But seeing that name makes me feel nostalgic. It even makes me cry when I say it out loud. Why...?
This person must have been very important to me.
No.
Even now, she's the most important person to me.
I'm sure I'm alive thanks to this person.
And I'm living for her.
#Club President
With that said. Please submit your work to the club magazine.
#Haruya
Alright.
#
With summer vacation just around the corner, the president and I are having a meeting about this last year’s club magazine.
#Club President
Well then, that's it.
#Haruya
President.
#
I involuntarily call out to the president when she was about to leave the club room.
#Club President
Yes?
#
I feel embarrassed to say something like this again, but since I have already stopped her, I have little choice but to go ahead with it.
#Haruya
President, this is the last club magazine of the year.
#Club President
That’s right.
#Haruya
It’s just… I’m going to miss you in the club.
#
The president blinks.
We look at each other in a strange atmosphere for a while, but then she bursts into laughter and says:
#Club President
You’ll be lonely, you say! Even though I barely showed my face.
#Haruya
But it’s not like you didn't come at all, either…
Besides, the two of us have been supporting this club since spring.
#Club President
Is it such a big deal? I don't remember spending any energy here.
#Haruya
Doesn’t that mean it was a comfortable place?
#
"Fufu," the president laughs. I laugh a little too.
She averts her eyes for a moment and looks hesitant, but in the end, she can’t hold back and ends up laughing.
#Club President
It can’t be helped. I have to graduate.
You will be alone next year.
#Haruya
Only if nobody else joins.
#Club President
How to say it…
I wouldn’t have high hopes, but I’m rooting for you.
#Haruya
You don’t think it can happen?
#Club President
Being negative is a bad habit of mine. And it's not easy for people to get out of their habits.
#
She laughs embarrassedly. She then opens the door of the clubroom and turns around one last time.
#Club President
But, well… Thank you. Take care.
#
After saying that, she leaves the room.
#
In the room where I’m alone, I open the window. The breeze and light of July enter the clubroom.
The outside world is bright and bathed in sunlight, and the colors that fly in are vivid to the eye.
The scenery seen from the window of this club room will change little by little with the change of time and seasons.
And that’s the moment I suddenly come up with it.
Yes, that's it.
Let's write about windows in the club magazine. Anything is fine, whether it's a novel or an essay about windows.
So I write about windows.
I don't remember what, but there's one thing that’s stuck to my mind.
Of a day when someone opened the window I wanted to open.
I can't imagine what it would be like in that situation. It seems like an ordinary daily gesture.
However, the fact that such a thing happened is strangely burned into my heart.
So, this is it.
I should leave notice somewhere in this world that such a thing happened. That’s what I feel.
I’ll never forget.
I think that, as I lean out the window.
I like being like this. I take my time to look at the distant scenery outside the window.
And the clubroom. This exact room I'm in right now.
At first, it felt cramped, but now I can say it with confidence:
I like this room.
It's small, but it has a big window, and it's full of my precious things and time.
Yes, I like this room.
