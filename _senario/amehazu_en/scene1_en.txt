Sharing an umbrella
# Senpai
“They say that the person who gets wetter while sharing an umbrella is the one most in love.”
# Haruya
“So they say.”
# Senpai
“Can I see your shoulder for a second?”
# Haruya
“Do you realize that, as a human being, that’s the worst thing you could have possibly said?
#
She chuckles next to me, under the same umbrella. One umbrella is too small for two people.
Our shoulders and arms touch again and again. Even though I’m being careful...
It’s so awkward.
“Woah. Haruya...”
One of my male classmates passing by glances at me before looking away. He’s riding his bicycle and wearing a raincoat. Under the raincoat, the rainy season school uniform is peeking out.
# Senpai
“Is he someone you know?”
# Haruya
“He's a classmate. Barely an acquaintance, really.”
# Senpai
“Hm...”
#
Looking at the back wearing the raincoat, she grins.
# Senpai
“That’s just right.”
# Haruya
“What is?”
# Senpai
“There’ll be rumors about us.”
# Haruya
“What are you talking about?”
# Senpai
“People also say that a rumor lasts 75 days.”
# Haruya
“So they say.”
# Senpai
“Yeah. And that’s more than enough.”
# Haruya
“More than enough for what? Two months... So, until august. Er, during summer vacation, about the rumors...”
#
# Senpai
“Indeed, what should I do?”
# Haruya
"Will you please do nothing…"
#
With a light smile, senpai simply replies that she would behave. My eyes are probably as moist as the humidity of the rainy season.
Her jet-black long hair was is from the rain and gave off a luster.
The color of my senpai’s hair is that of a wet crow feather. Her dark eyes, which stand out against with her white skin, are peeking behind her long eyelashes.
Her gaze turns to me. My consciousness is sucked into those eyes like the night sky.
My heart jumps as if I have tripped, and my breath becomes a lump in my throat, blocking it.
I turn my face away in reflex. Then, she puts her lips close to my ear.
# Senpai
“You’re embarrassed. Your face is beet red."
# Haruya
“Please don't whisper in my ear. I'll close the umbrella."
# Senpai
“That’s fine by me? I was about to go home wet anyway."
#
Today, she didn’t bring her umbrella.
When it was time to go home, she walked briskly from the school entrance in the middle of the rain, she turned around and called out to me with a “shall we go?”
A weirdo, an eccentric… Yet beautiful. That’s my senpai.
While admiring this always striking person, I raised the umbrella over my her head.
And now here we are.
# Senpai
“I quite like walking in the rain, though.”
# Haruya
"What would you like about that?"
# Senpai
"Even if you cry, nobody will find out."
# Haruya
“Huh...?”
#
# Senpai
"Oh?　Was my joke too high level?"
# Haruya
"I'm so tired I could cry..."
#
# Senpai
"Should I hold the umbrella now?”
# Haruya
“No, it’s fine!”
#
We walk in the sound of rain. When sharing an umbrella, your steps are much slower than usual.
That means more time to talk and even more of my senpai’s unique conversation.
The amount of chatter spouting from her lips is akin to the amount of rainfall during the rainy season.
Eventually, we come to an intersection. From there onwards, I’ll go straight while she’ll turn.
This is the place to say goodbye.
# Senpai
“Thanks, Haruya-kun."
#
We look at each other under the umbrella.
# Senpai
“For letting me under your umbrella, thank you! I’ll be fine from here.”
# Haruya
"Will you walk by yourself?　In this rain?"
#
She nods. Many thoughts come to mind.
Senpai will get drenched...
Won’t it be better if I accompany her halfway through? Even someone like her can get sick after walking under the rain.
But if I suggest that, won’t it be a nuisance for her?
Since, in the first place, she herself said it was okay…
#
# Senpai
“Then, Haruya-kun. See you tomorrow.”
# Haruya
“Ah...”
#
My voice is clogged. Before I realize, my mouth is moving on its own.
# Haruya
“Yes... See you tomorrow.”
#
I let out a sigh while looking at her back getting smaller in the distance.
See you...
While I was hesitating whether to speak up or not, I missed my timing and the moment flowed away.
Whenever something like this happens, I’m left with a bad aftertaste.
If she were to catch a cold because of this, I’m sure today’s event would weigh on my conscience forever.
My shirt is getting wet on the right shoulder. The moist feeling makes me return to reality.
Before I get any wetter I start heading back home, my guilt trailing behind me like a shadow.
I can hear the sound of rain in the distance. While being alone under an umbrella is spacious, it feels somewhat empty.
